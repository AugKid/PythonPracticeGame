This is based on the game "Zork" where you choose your own adventure.

#Goals to keep in mind
#The game is created to work on personal scripting mechanics and functions. 
#The game will also teach version control 
#The game will evolve depending on skills learns, i.e if adding database functions will be useful
 
Game will be the base\Template for multiple games, the goal is to create multiple genres but not limited to ; 
#Game will start with the user accessing a command that would ask to choose what sort of game would you like to play. The game will either ask you to select either a "Horror" or a "Dating Sim"
#From there it will be two path until the code ends. 

1.Horror
#Objective of Horror will be an "Escape the Room" simulation. 
# Scipritng goals : Variables, Random Generator for actions (implies possible machine learning method, depending if I learn it correcty). May intigrate images , 

2.Dating Sim
# Scripting goals : Create Machine Learning that are used for bots , i.e bots that are used for website when dealing with a virtual agent. 

3.Unknown 
#  When creating the game, theres needs to be a " learned lesson " to move forward with the game. 

#The following game will be simple but will be modified over and over again for changes. The goal is not create an amazing game, but to create consistent coding practice. 
Will attempt to make the game entertaining but it will be a 2nd priority. 

#Another .txt will be created to list patch notes.
